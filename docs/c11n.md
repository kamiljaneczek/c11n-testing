# C11N testing Constellation based applications

## Project Overview
This is a sample project and small starter kit  owcasing how to test Constellation based applications using modern JavaScript and TypeScript based testing frameworks.

Main goal is to show how to test both UI and API using Cucumber and Playwright. Code is written in a way that is easy to understand and modify at the same time adhering to best practices. 

## Functionalities Implemented
- End-to-End Testing: The repository is set up for end-to-end testing using Playwright and Cucumber. 
- It supports both UI e2e, feature testing as well as API testing
    - UI e2e testing and API testing is done using Playwright
    - Feature testing is done using Cucumber
- BDD testing is done using Cucumber
- Cucumber is used for writing tests in plain English, which are then mapped to step definitions in TypeScript.
- Playwright is used for browser automation, allowing for UI testing and interaction with web pages.
- API Testing: 
    - The repository includes API test specifications as well as utility functions for making API requests to create sample data
- User Role Management: Different user roles (e.g., case worker, manager, customer, dispatcher) are defined and used in tests to simulate various user interactions.
- Test Data Management: Test data is loaded from JSON files and validated using TypeScript schemas, ensuring consistency and correctness in tests.
- Portal testing: Functions are provided for navigating the standard Constellation portals (both Select Service and Standard portal) and verifying the presence of UI elements. Functions included in this starting pack are generic and can reused in other project base on Constellation without any changes.
- Incident testing: Functions are provided for progressing an incident through the incident portal and verifying the presence of UI elements. Functions included in this starting pack are generic (ie. selecting value from dropdowns, clicking buttons, etc) and can reused in other project based on Constellation without any changes.
